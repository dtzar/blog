# Technical Content Blog Posts

This is the home for technical markdown content and attached code samples I create.  This content is longer than what I'd like to cover in a blog post and would like to allow for pull request contribution/fixes. 
Likely these will be referenced by a short blog post at http://GoodChangeIT.com with additional surrounding context.
